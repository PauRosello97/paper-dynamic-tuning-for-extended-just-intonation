@report{Sabat2008,
  abstract = {Subtle inflections of pitch, often performed intuitively by musicians, create a harmonically sensitive expressive intonation. As each new pitch is added to a simultaneously sounding structure, very small variations in its tuning have a substantial impact on overall harmonic comprehensibility. In this project, James Tenney's multidimensional lattice model of intervals ('harmonic space') and a related measure of relative consonance ('harmonic distance') are used to evaluate and optimize the clarity of sound combinations. A set of tuneable intervals, expressed as whole-number frequency ratios, forms the basis for real-time harmonic microtuning. An algorithm, which references this set, allows a computer music instrument to adjust the intonation of input frequencies based on previously sounded frequencies and several user-specified parameters (initial reference frequency, tolerance range, prime limit). Various applications of the algorithm are envisioned: to find relationships within components of a spectral analysis, to dynamically adjust computer instruments, to research the tuneability of complex microtonal pitch structures. Most generally, it furthers investigations into the processes underlying harmonic perception, and how these may lead to musical applications.},

@article{Stange2017,
  abstract = {We investigate a dynamically adapting tuning scheme for microtonal tuning of musical instruments, allowing the performer to play music in just intonation in any key. Unlike other methods, which are based on a procedural analysis of the chordal structure, the tuning scheme continually solves a system of linear equations without making explicit decisions. In complex situations, where not all intervals of a chord can be tuned according to just frequency ratios, the method automatically yields a tempered compromise. We outline the implementation of the algorithm in an open-source software project that we have provided in order to demonstrate the feasibility of the tuning method.},

@article{Trueman2020,
  abstract = {Combining a new software system with the familiar interface of the MIDI keyboard, bitKlavier is a versatile instrument for exploring the nature of tuning and temperament. We describe a number of approaches it facilitates, including composed tunings, moving fundamental systems, and a novel system for adaptive tuning. All of these are characterized by the overarching design priority for bitKlavier to be a context for musical play and exploration, as opposed to finding singular, "correct" solutions to particular tuning "problems," as has often been the case historically.},
